Abstract
In order to improve the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma, I develo-
ped a cell segmentation model based on machine learning through
fine-tuning and supervised training. This approach not only allows for
the precise counting of cells in images but also differentiates between
adjacent cells using instance segmentation, addressing a common
challenge in manual analysis. Currently, this process is performed
manually by healthcare professionals using nuclear staining and in
situ hybridization images.
To make this technological solution more accessible and simplify
the work of healthcare professionals, I designed a desktop application
for cell segmentation from FISH images. Subsequently, I integrated
the trained model from Google Colab into this application via an
API, optimizing the workflow in the laboratory environment.
